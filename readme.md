# API

## Setup

1. Go to Settings -> Pages 
2. Pick a `branch` and the `root folder (/)` and save it
    * It's annoying that the admin of the repo can't change this. Only the owner of the project can.

For the `api/index.html` (the json payload file), we need to make sure the image link is correct!
## Folder structure

* `index.html` will be served directly (don't need to specify it in the URL)
* Creating folder of name `a` acts as appending the URL with `/a`
